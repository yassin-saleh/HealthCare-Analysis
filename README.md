🩺 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Healthcare
This project performs an exploratory data analysis on a healthcare dataset related to cancer in the UAE. The goal is to understand the structure, patterns, and potential insights from the dataset using standard EDA techniques.

📁 Dataset
Name: _cancer_dataset_uae.csv

Source: Local file (must be provided in the same directory as the notebook)

Description: Contains healthcare-related attributes, possibly cancer-related demographic or medical records from the UAE.

🧪 EDA Steps Performed
Understanding the problem and dataset

Importing and inspecting the dataset

Handling missing values

Exploring data characteristics

Performing data transformation

Visualizing relationships between variables

Detecting and handling outliers

Communicating findings and insights

📊 Visualizations Used
Count Plots (sns.countplot)

Box Plots (sns.boxplot)

Scatter Plots (sns.scatterplot)

Correlation Heatmap (sns.heatmap)

Matplotlib charts (plt.title, plt.xlabel, etc.)

These visualizations help in identifying data distribution, relationships, trends, and outliers.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

pandas, numpy for data processing

matplotlib, seaborn for visualizations

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:
